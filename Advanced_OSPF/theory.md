# OSPF LSA Types

## LSA Type 1 – Router LSA
- Generated by **every router**.
- Describes **directly connected links** (interfaces, IP addresses, costs).
- Flooded **only inside the area**.

## LSA Type 2 – Network LSA
- Generated by the **Designated Router (DR)** in multi-access networks (e.g., Ethernet).
- Describes the routers connected to that network and the subnet.
- Limited to the **same area**.

## LSA Type 3 – Summary LSA
- Generated by an **Area Border Router (ABR)**.
- Used to advertise **network prefixes between areas**.
- Summarizes routes of one area into another without detailed topology.
- In the routing table, it appears as **O IA**.

## LSA Type 4 – ASBR Summary LSA
- Generated by an **ABR**.
- Advertises the **location of an ASBR** to other areas.
- Informs other routers how to **reach the ASBR**.

## LSA Type 5 – AS External LSA
- Generated by an **ASBR**.
- Advertises **external routes** (redistributed from other protocols like RIP or BGP).
- Flooded to the **whole OSPF domain**, except restricted areas.

## LSA Type 6 – Group Membership LSA
- Designed for **Multicast OSPF (MOSPF)**.
- Not supported by Cisco and considered **obsolete**.

## LSA Type 7 – NSSA External LSA
- Used in **Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSA)**.
- Advertises external routes inside the NSSA.
- An ABR **converts Type 7 LSAs into Type 5 LSAs** when propagating them outside the NSSA.

## LSA Types 8, 9, 10, 11 – Opaque LSAs
- Used for **OSPF extensions**.
- Example: **Traffic Engineering (OSPF-TE)**, bandwidth information, and custom applications.
- **Type 8**: external attributes (OSPFv2).
- **Types 9, 10, 11**: different scopes for custom purposes.

# Key OSPF Command Syntax

## Task vs. Command

| **Task** | **Command Syntax** |
|----------|---------------------|
| Initialize the OSPF process | `router ospf process-id` |
| Summarize routes crossing an OSPF ABR | `area area-id range network subnet-mask [advertise \| not-advertise] [cost metric]` |
| Filter routes crossing an OSPF ABR | `area area-id filter-list prefix prefix-list-name {in \| out}` |
| Filter OSPF routes from entering the RIB | `distribute-list {acl-number \| acl-name \| prefix prefix-list-name \| route-map route-map-name} in` |
| Display the LSAs in the LSDB | `show ip ospf database [router \| network \| summary]` |
