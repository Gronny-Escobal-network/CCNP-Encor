# OSPF LSA Types

## LSA Type 1 â€“ Router LSA
- Generated by **every router**.
- Describes **directly connected links** (interfaces, IP addresses, costs).
- Flooded **only inside the area**.

## LSA Type 2 â€“ Network LSA
- Generated by the **Designated Router (DR)** in multi-access networks (e.g., Ethernet).
- Describes the routers connected to that network and the subnet.
- Limited to the **same area**.

## LSA Type 3 â€“ Summary LSA
- Generated by an **Area Border Router (ABR)**.
- Used to advertise **network prefixes between areas**.
- Summarizes routes of one area into another without detailed topology.
- In the routing table, it appears as **O IA**.

## LSA Type 4 â€“ ASBR Summary LSA
- Generated by an **ABR**.
- Advertises the **location of an ASBR** to other areas.
- Informs other routers how to **reach the ASBR**.

## LSA Type 5 â€“ AS External LSA
- Generated by an **ASBR**.
- Advertises **external routes** (redistributed from other protocols like RIP or BGP).
- Flooded to the **whole OSPF domain**, except restricted areas.

## LSA Type 6 â€“ Group Membership LSA
- Designed for **Multicast OSPF (MOSPF)**.
- Not supported by Cisco and considered **obsolete**.

## LSA Type 7 â€“ NSSA External LSA
- Used in **Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSA)**.
- Advertises external routes inside the NSSA.
- An ABR **converts Type 7 LSAs into Type 5 LSAs** when propagating them outside the NSSA.

## LSA Types 8, 9, 10, 11 â€“ Opaque LSAs
- Used for **OSPF extensions**.
- Example: **Traffic Engineering (OSPF-TE)**, bandwidth information, and custom applications.
- **Type 8**: external attributes (OSPFv2).
- **Types 9, 10, 11**: different scopes for custom purposes.

-----
## Stub Area
ðŸ‘‰Blocks external LSAs (type 5).

ðŸ‘‰Gets a default route from the ABR.

ðŸ‘‰Reduces routing table size.
On all routers in the area:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 stub
```
On the ABR:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 stub
```

## Totally Stubby Area (Cisco Proprietary)
ðŸ‘‰Blocks external LSAs (type 5) and inter-area summaries (type 3).

ðŸ‘‰Only keeps intra-area routes and one default route.
On the ABR:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 stub no-summary
```
On the internal routers:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 stub
```

## NSSA (Not-So-Stubby Area)
ðŸ‘‰Blocks external LSAs (type 5).

ðŸ‘‰Allows an ASBR inside the area to inject external routes as type 7 LSAs.

ðŸ‘‰ABR translates LSA type 7 into type 5.
On all routers in the area:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 nssa
```
If an ASBR inside the NSSA redistributes routes:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 nssa
 redistribute connected subnets
```
âœ…The ABR will translate LSA type 7 into type 5.

## Totally NSSA
ðŸ‘‰Same as NSSA but also blocks inter-area summaries (type 3).

ðŸ‘‰Only gets a default route, intra-area routes, and translated externals.
On the ABR:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 nssa no-summary
```
On the internal routers:
```bash
router ospf 100
 area 10 nssa
```
